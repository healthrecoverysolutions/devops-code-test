**You will need Docker running locally to test this**

## Instruction

This creates a Docker container for Wordpress on the local Docker machine.

Update the configuration to launch N instances of the container based on the `wordpress_instance_count` variable using ports 9001 through 9xxx for the respective number of instances provided. The output should be changed to reflect the private IP of each container in a comma-separated list (e.g. `ip = 172.1.0.1,172.1.0.2,172.1.0.3,172.1.0.4,172.1.0.5`)

In your submitted PR, please put the output from both `terraform plan` and the output after `terraform apply` below with 3 containers provided as value on the `wordpress_instance_count` variable.

## Terrform Plan

```
$ terraform plan
```
```
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
